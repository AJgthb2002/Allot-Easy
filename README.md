## Seat allotment system for colleges

Data Structures & Algorithms based group project.<br>

Aim of this project is to understand how the college seat allotment is done at State level and simulate the same for the branch-wise seats of a  single college.
This is a completely merit based allocation system, which takes into account the Common Entrance Test (CET) scores and branch preferences of the candidates.<br>

Developed for **Buffer 2.0** project series- an initiative of team Loop at Cummins College of Engineering, Pune.

Python Libraries used: <br>
Pandas, csv (for handling .csv data file )<br>
Flask, Pywebio (for GUI)
